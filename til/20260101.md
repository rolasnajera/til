Today I learned about the concept of "til" (today I learned) notes, which are brief entries documenting new knowledge or insights gained on a particular day.
These notes can be useful for personal growth, reflection, and sharing knowledge with others.

My Today I Learned snippets. Inspired by jbranchaud/til, which I spotted on Hacker News.
